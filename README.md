# Next.js 15 Build Error: Missing Module or Import Issue

This repository demonstrates a common build error in Next.js 15 applications, specifically those related to missing or incorrectly configured dependencies.  The error typically manifests during the build process, hindering deployment and application functionality.

## Problem Description

The `bug.js` file showcases a minimal Next.js application.  However, if a dependency is missing or an import statement is incorrect, the Next.js build process will fail.  This issue is often encountered when new packages are added, existing dependencies are updated, or there are errors in the project's configuration.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected version.  The solution will depend on the specific error message.  In general, solutions involve:

*   Ensuring all necessary dependencies are listed in `package.json` and properly installed (`npm install` or `yarn install`).
*   Verifying correct import paths and statement syntax in your JavaScript files.
*   Reviewing Next.js documentation and troubleshooting resources.
